# QR-code
QR CODE GENERATING 

✅ 1. Clone or Download the Project

If you haven't already:

git clone https://github.com/ranjitham2927/QR-code.git

Or download the ZIP from GitHub and extract it.
✅ 2. Understand the Structure

Look inside the folder:

    If you see index.html, it's a web-based project.

    It may use plain HTML/JS or Python backend.

✅ 3. Copy Files to Your Project

You can copy these folders/files into your own project directory:

    index.html

    script.js (or whatever JS file is there)

    style.css

    Any image or asset folders (assets, img, etc.)

✅ 4. Integrate into Your Project

If you're building a bigger site:

    Embed the QR generator code into your existing HTML.

    Ensure CSS and JS paths are correct.

    Add animation or style changes if needed.

✅ 5. Run Your Combined Project

Open index.html or launch your app depending on the environment (browser, Flask, Node, etc.).
